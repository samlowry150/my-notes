shapes with interiors can be filled with the fill function.

```
 
- strokeWeight(number); will allow you to set the thickness of the strokes.

- noStroke(); will delete the stroke.

- stroke(c) will set the stroke to be the grayscale color (c, c, c).

## Color Variables
Itâ€™s often convenient to store colors in variables. They make the prgram more readable, and you can change the colors easily later. For example:

```
color orange = color(255, 165, 0);
color darkGreen = color(0, 50, 0);
color white = color(255, 255, 255);
```
